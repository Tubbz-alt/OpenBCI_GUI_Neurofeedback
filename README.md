### Neurofeedback widget for the OpenBCI_GUI

This version of standard [OpenBCI_GUI](https://github.com/OpenBCI/OpenBCI_GUI) adds a tone neurofeedback for alpha band (7.5-12.5Hz) for all channels. The tone is hardcoded. The feedback is both with amplitude of the tone and slight changes of frequency. The tone is different for each feedback channel. This is a pretty basic, but working feedback proof of concept.

Caveats: 

- I recommend turning unused channels off before starting (use keys 1-8)
- Tune down the volume when starting :)

The code tries to detect artifacts (like jaw movement) by ignoring "superloud tones" over a certain maximal amplitude - when the tone goes over this threshold, the tone is actually set to total silence.

You can use this software instead of official and the neurofeedback should just work when you select
the neurofeedback widget in the GUI :).

# OpenBCI_GUI_v2.0
Based on OpenBCI_Processing, OpenBCI_GUI_v2.0 extends the GUI to include additional features, and interfaces with the OpenBCI [Cyton](http://shop.openbci.com/collections/frontpage/products/openbci-32-bit-board-kit?variant=784651699) and [Ganglion](http://shop.openbci.com/collections/frontpage/products/pre-order-ganglion-board?variant=13461804483) hardware systems. Tutorials, and getting started guides can be found on the [OpenBCI Learning Pages](http://docs.openbci.com/Getting%20Started/00-Welcome).
